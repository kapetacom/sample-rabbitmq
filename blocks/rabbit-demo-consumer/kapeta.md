# Kapeta Readme
This file contains some structural information about this service.

This file will be overwritten every time you change the service definition in Kapeta.

## Folder Structure
This service is structured as follows:

### Generated files
All files in the following folders are generated by Kapeta - and should not be edited manually.
* ```src/.generated/config```: Contains your configuration entities
* ```src/.generated/data```: Contains anything related to databases
* ```src/.generated/entities```: Contains the public entities used by the service.

### Editable files
All other files are editable - and will not be overwritten by Kapeta unless explictly mentioned in the file.

* ```src/service```: Contains the service layer logic. This is where you should add your business logic

### Path alias for generated files

To import generated files you can use the following path alias:
```typescript
import { MyEntity } from 'generated:entities/MyEntity';
```




## RabbitMQ Subscriber
To consume messages from a RabbitMQ queue a consumer is generated for you for each resource.

Use the constructor function to create a new consumer.

Below is an example of how to use the consumer to listen for messages on the queue:
```javascript
import { ConfigProvider, runApp } from '@kapeta/sdk-config';
import { createServer } from './src/server';
import { createRoutes } from 'generated:routes';
import { addEventsSubscriber } from 'generated:queues/events-subscriber';
import { TypedAsyncMessage } from '@kapeta/sdk-rabbitmq';
import { Event } from 'generated:entities/Logs';

// runApp is a helper function that will load the configuration from Kapeta and then run the provided function
runApp(async (configProvider: ConfigProvider) => {
    // Create the server - see src/server/server.ts for more information
    const server = createServer(configProvider);

    // Add a subscriber to the events queue
    await addEventsSubscriber(configProvider, (event:Event, msg:TypedAsyncMessage<Event>) => {
        console.log('Received events', events, msg);
    })

    // Includes the generated routes for your API resources
    server.use(await createRoutes(configProvider));

    server.start('rest');
}, __dirname);

```
